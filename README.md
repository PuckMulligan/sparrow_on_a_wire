# sparrow_on_a_wire


sparrow_on_a_wire is a hacking-puzzle game that introduces real hacking techniques in a form that's approachable and fun. By combining real-working hacking metholodgy and command-line manipulation with logic-puzzle games, sparrow_on_a_wire simulates real hacking techniques in a way that's accessible without any prior technical knowledge of command lines, network protocols or other technical procedures.

The game is current in a demo state consisting of a single server which the player will attempt to gain access, take control, execute remote commands and exfiltrate sensitive data.

The game will also feature a 2D overworld in which to explore, meet a colourful cast of characters and discover new missions and clues.
